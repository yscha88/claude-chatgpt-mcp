- **Install and run the package using NPX:**

```bash
npx claude-chatgpt-mcp
```

- **Configure Claude Desktop:**

Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` file (located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`) to include this tool:

```json
"chatgpt-mcp": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["claude-chatgpt-mcp"]
}
```

- **Restart the Claude Desktop app**

- **Grant necessary permissions:**
  - Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Privacy
  - Give Terminal (or iTerm) access to Accessibility features
  - You may see permission prompts when the tool is first used

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syedazharmbnr1/claude-chatgpt-mcp.git
cd claude-chatgpt-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x index.ts
```

4. Update your Claude Desktop configuration:

Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` file (located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`) to include this tool:

```json
"chatgpt-mcp": {
  "command": "/Users/YOURUSERNAME/.bun/bin/bun",
  "args": ["run", "/path/to/claude-chatgpt-mcp/index.ts"]
}
```

Make sure to replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual macOS username and adjust the path to where you cloned this repository.

5. Restart Claude Desktop app

6. Grant permissions:
   - Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Privacy
   - Give Terminal (or iTerm) access to Accessibility features
   - You may see permission prompts when the tool is first used

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the ChatGPT tool directly from Claude by asking questions like:

- "Can you ask ChatGPT what the capital of France is?"
- "Show me my recent ChatGPT conversations"
- "Ask ChatGPT to explain quantum computing"

## Troubleshooting

If the tool isn't working properly:

1. Make sure ChatGPT app is installed and you're logged in
2. Verify the path to bun in your claude_desktop_config.json is correct
3. Check that you've granted all necessary permissions
4. Try restarting both Claude and ChatGPT apps

## Optimizations

This fork includes several significant improvements to the original implementation:

### Enhanced AppleScript Robustness

#### Conversation Retrieval
- Added multiple UI element targeting approaches to handle ChatGPT UI changes
- Implemented better error detection with specific error messages
- Added fallback mechanisms using accessibility attributes
- Improved timeout handling with appropriate delays

#### Response Handling
- Replaced fixed waiting times with dynamic response detection
- Added intelligent completion detection that recognizes when ChatGPT has finished typing
- Implemented text stability detection (waits until text stops changing)
- Added response extraction logic to isolate just the relevant response text
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages
- Added post-processing to clean up UI elements from responses
- Implemented incomplete response detection to warn about potential cutoffs

These optimizations make the integration more reliable across different scenarios, more resilient to UI changes in the ChatGPT application, and better at handling longer response times without message cutoff issues.
